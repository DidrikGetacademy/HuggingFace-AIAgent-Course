Understanding AI Agents through the [Thought-Action-Observation Cycle]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Core Components--->
Agents work in a continuous cycle of:  thinking (thought) --> acting(Act) and observing(Observe)

1. Thought: The LLM part of the Agent decides what the next step should be. 

2. Action: The agent takes an action, by calling the tools with the associated arguments.

3. Observation: The model reflects on the response from the tool








The Thought-Action-Observation Cycle
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The three components work together in a continious loop. to use an analogy from programming, the agent uses a (while loop): the loop continues until the objective of the agent has been fulfilled.


LLM Thought Process Visualised
-------------------------------
Query --> Think ---> Action ---> Observation ---> Think/End  #Finish or another action needed?





In many Agent frameworks, the rules and guidelines are embedded directly into the system prompt, ensuring that every cycle adheres to a defined logic.

system_message="""You are an AI assistant desgined to help users efficiently and accurately. Your
primary goal is to provide helpful, precise, and clear responses.

you have access to the following tools:
Tool Name: calculator, description: multiply two integers., Arguments: a: int, b: int, Outputs: int

You should think step by step in order to fulfill the objective with a reasoning devided in 
Thought/Action/Observation that can repeat multiple times if needed.

You should first reflect with `Thought: {your_thoughts}` on the current situation,
then (if necessary ), call a tool with the proper JSON formatting `Action: {JSON_BLOB}` , or your print 
your final answear tarting with the prefix `Final Answer:`

ðŸ“Œwe see here that in the System Message we defined: 
âœ….The Agent's behavior.
âœ…The Tools our Agent has access to, as we described in the previous section.
âœ…The Thought-Action-Observation Cycle, that we bake into the LLM instructions.



Let's take a small example to understand the process before going deeper into each step of the process.

Alfred, the weather Agent
we created Alfred, the Weather Agent.
a user asks Alfred: "What's the weather like in New York today?"
Alfred's job is to answear this query using a weather API tool.

Here's how the cycle unfolds:

âœ…Thought


âœ…Internal Reasoning: 
Upon Receiving the query, Alfred's internal dialogue might be:

"The user needs current weather information for New York. I have access to a tool that fetches weather data. First i need to call the weather API to get up-to-date details."

this step shows the agent breaking the problem into steps: first, gathering the necessary data.


âœ…Action
Tool Usage: 
based on its reasoning the fact that alfred knows about a get_weather tool, Alfred prepares a JSON-formatted command that call the weather API tool. for example, its first action could be
