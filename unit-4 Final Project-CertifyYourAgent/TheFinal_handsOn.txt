The process
Now the big question in your mind is probably : “How do I start submitting ?”

For this Unit, we created an API that will allow you to get the questions, and send your answers for scoring. Here is a summary of the routes (see the live documentation for interactive details):

GET /questions: Retrieve the full list of filtered evaluation questions.
GET /random-question: Fetch a single random question from the list.
GET /files/{task_id}: Download a specific file associated with a given task ID.
POST /submit: Submit agent answers, calculate the score, and update the leaderboard.
The submit function will compare the answer to the ground truth in an EXACT MATCH manner, hence prompt it well ! The GAIA team shared a prompting example for your agent here (https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard)  (for the sake of this course, make sure you don’t include the text “FINAL ANSWER” in your submission, just make your agent reply with the answer and nothing else).

🎨 Make the Template Your Own!

To demonstrate the process of interacting with the API, we’ve included a basic template as a starting point.

Please feel free—and actively encouraged—to change, add to, or completely restructure it! Modify it in any way that best suits your approach and creativity.

In order to submit this templates compute 3 things needed by the API :

Username: Your Hugging Face username (here obtained via Gradio login), which is used to identify your submission.
Code Link (agent_code): the URL linking to your Hugging Face Space code (.../tree/main) for verification purposes, so please keep your space public.
Answers (answers): The list of responses ({"task_id": ..., "submitted_answer": ...}) generated by your Agent for scoring.
Hence we encourage you to start by duplicating this template on your own huggingface profile.

🏆 Check out the leaderboard here

A friendly note: This leaderboard is meant for fun! We know it’s possible to submit scores without full verification. If we see too many high scores posted without a public link to back them up, we might need to review, adjust, or remove some entries to keep the leaderboard useful. The leaderboard will show the link to your space code-base, since this leaderboard is for students only, please keep your space public if you get a score you’re proud of.
