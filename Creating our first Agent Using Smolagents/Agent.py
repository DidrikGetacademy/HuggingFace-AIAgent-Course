#Serverless API
#-----------------------------------------
#In the Hugging Face ecosystem, there is a convenient future called Serverless API that allows you to easily run inference on many models. There's no installation or deployment required. 
##You need a token from https://hf.co/settings/tokens, ensure that you select 'read' as the token type. If you run this on Google Colab, you can set it up in the "settings" tab under "secrets". Make sure to call it "HF_TOKEN"


#Getting the HF_TOKEN from .env 
load_dotenv()
hf_token = os.getenv("HF_TOKEN")
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"]=hf_token

#‚úÖAs seen in the LLM section, if we just do decoding, the model will only stop when it predicts an EOS token, and this does not happen here because this is a conversational (chat) model and we didn‚Äôt apply the chat template it expects.
#‚úÖIf we now add the special tokens related to the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model that we‚Äôre using, the behavior changes and it now produces the expected EOS.
