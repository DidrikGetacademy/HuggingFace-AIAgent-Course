#Serverless API
#-----------------------------------------
#In the Hugging Face ecosystem, there is a convenient future called Serverless API that allows you to easily run inference on many models. There's no installation or deployment required. 
##You need a token from https://hf.co/settings/tokens, ensure that you select 'read' as the token type. If you run this on Google Colab, you can set it up in the "settings" tab under "secrets". Make sure to call it "HF_TOKEN"


#Getting Values from .env 
Huggingface_Token = os.getenv("Hugging_face_login")
load_dotenv()
hf_token = os.getenv("HF_TOKEN")
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"]=hf_token
