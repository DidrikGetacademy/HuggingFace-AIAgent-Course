Dummy Agent Libary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📌This course is framework-agnostic because we want to focus on the concepts of AI agents and avoid getting bogged down in the specifics of a particular framework.

📌Also, we want students to be able to use the concepts they learn in this course in their own projects, using any framework they like.

📌Therefore, for this Unit 1, we will use a dummy agent library and a simple serverless API to access our LLM engine.

📌You probably wouldn’t use these in production, but they will serve as a good starting point for understanding how agents work.


✅After this section, you’ll be ready to create a simple Agent using smolagents

✅And in the following Units we will also use other AI Agent libraries like LangGraph, LangChain, and LlamaIndex.

✅To keep things simple we will use a simple Python function as a Tool and Agent.

✅We will use built-in Python packages like datetime and os so that you can try it out in any environment.

✅You can follow the process in this notebook and run the code yourself.
