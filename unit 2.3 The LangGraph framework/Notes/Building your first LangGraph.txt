Building Your First LangGraph
Now that we understand the building blocks, let’s put them into practice by building our first functional graph. We’ll implement Alfred’s email processing system, where he needs to:

1. Read incoming emails
2. Classify them as spam or legitimate
3. Draft a preliminary response for legitimate emails
4. Send information to Mr. Wayne when legitimate (printing only)
This example demonstrates how to structure a workflow with LangGraph that involves LLM-based decision-making. While this can’t be considered an Agent as no tool is involved, this section focuses more on learning the LangGraph framework than Agents.
