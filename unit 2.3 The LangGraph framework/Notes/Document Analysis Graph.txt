Document Analysis Graph
Alfred at your service. As Mr. Wayne’s trusted butler, I’ve taken the liberty of documenting how I assist Mr Wayne with his various documentary needs. 
While he’s out attending to his… nighttime activities, I ensure all his paperwork, training schedules, and nutritional plans are properly analyzed and organized.

Before leaving, he left a note with his week’s training program. I then took the responsibility to come up with a menu for tomorrow’s meals.

For future such events, let’s create a document analysis system using LangGraph to serve Mr. Wayne’s needs. This system can:

1.Process images document
2.Extract text using vision models (Vision Language Model)
3.Perform calculations when needed (to demonstrate normal tools)
4.Analyze content and provide concise summaries
5.Execute specific instructions related to documents
