Welcome to this next part of our journey, where you’ll learn how to build applications using the LangGraph framework designed to help you structure and orchestrate complex LLM workflows.

LangGraph is a framework that allows you to build production-ready applications by giving you control tools over the flow of your agent.

Module Overview
In this unit, you’ll discover:

1️⃣ What is LangGraph, and when to use it?
2️⃣ Building Blocks of LangGraph
3️⃣ Alfred, the mail sorting butler
4️⃣ Alfred, the document Analyst agent
5️⃣ Quiz
The examples in this section require access to a powerful LLM/VLM model. We ran them using the GPT-4o API because it has the best compatibility with langGraph.
By the end of this unit, you’ll be equipped to build robust, organized and production ready applications !

That being said, this section is an introduction to langGraph and more advances topics can be discovered in the free langChain academy course : Introduction to LangGraph
