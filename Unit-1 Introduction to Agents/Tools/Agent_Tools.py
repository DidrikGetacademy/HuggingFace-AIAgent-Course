#Textual description of what we want the LLM to know about the tools it has available.
#-The system_message sets the context for the AI, explaining its role and available tools.
#define the system message with a placeholder for tool descriptions
#âœ…The LLM does not inherently "know" what a tool is â€“ it understands them because the system message injects descriptions.
#âœ…If tool descriptions are ambiguous, the LLM might not call the right tool.
#ðŸ“Œ The system message provides essential context for the LLM. It does not execute tools itself but instead generates a structured request (like a function call) based on its understanding of the tools defined in {tools_description}. A well-defined tool description ensures the LLM correctly chooses and formats function calls.

#the provided Tool class is a class that represents a tool.
#Generic Tool implementation
#We create a generic Tool class that we can reuse whenever we need to use a tool.
#âœ… outputs can be a string or list, since some tools return multiple values.
#âœ…to_string() method helps dynamically document tools, which is why itâ€™s useful.
#ðŸ“Œ The Tool class provides a structured way to define reusable tools. It wraps a function with metadata (name, description, arguments, and outputs), allowing the LLM to call it dynamically. The to_string() method generates a readable description, which can be used in the system message to inform the LLM about available tools.
