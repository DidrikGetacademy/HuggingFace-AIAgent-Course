📝Multi-agent systems enable specialized agents to collaborate on complex tasks

📝In smolagents, different agents can be combined to generate Python code, call external tools, perform web searches, and more. By orchestrating these agents, we can create powerful workflows.


📝A typical multi agent system setup might include:
        -A Manager Agent for task delegation
        -A Code Interpreter Agent for code execution
        -A Web Search Agent for information retrieval


📝illustrates a simple multi-agent architecture where a Manager Agent coordinates a Code Interpreter Tool and a Web Search Agent, which in turn utilizes tools like the DuckDuckGoSearchTool and VisitWebpageTool to gather relevant information.

               /              \
              /                \
Code-Interpreter-Agent          Web-Search-Agent
                                \                \
                                 \                \
                          Web-Search-tool         Visit-Webpage-tool


✅A multi-agent system consists of multiple specialized agents working together under the coordination of an Orchestrator Agent. 
📌This approach enables complex workflows by distributing tasks among agents with distinct roles.


📝For example, a Multi-Agent RAG system can integrate:
➡A Web Agent for browsing the internet.
➡A Retriever Agent for fetching information from knowledge bases.
➡An Image Generation Agent for producing visuals.
