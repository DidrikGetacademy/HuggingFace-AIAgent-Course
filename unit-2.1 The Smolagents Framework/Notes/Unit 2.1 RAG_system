Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine the capabilities of data retrieval and generation models to provide context-aware responses. 
For example, a user’s query is passed to a search engine, and the retrieved results are given to the model along with the query. 
The model then generates a response based on the query and retrieved information.

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) extends traditional RAG systems by combining autonomous agents with dynamic knowledge retrieval.

While traditional RAG systems use an LLM to answer queries based on retrieved data, 
agentic RAG enables intelligent control of both retrieval and generation processes,
improving efficiency and accuracy.


Traditional RAG systems face key limitations, 
such as relying on a single retrieval step and focusing on direct semantic similarity with the user’s query, which may overlook relevant information.

Agentic RAG addresses these issues by allowing the agent to autonomously formulate search queries,
 critique retrieved results, and conduct multiple retrieval steps for a more tailored and comprehensive output.

Basic Retrieval with DuckDuckGo
Let’s build a simple agent that can search the web using DuckDuckGo. This agent will retrieve information and synthesize responses to answer queries. With Agentic RAG, Alfred’s agent can:

Search for latest superhero party trends
Refine results to include luxury elements
Synthesize information into a complete plan
Here’s how Alfred’s agent can achieve this: Basic_retrieval_duckducktogo.py






Custom Knowledge Base Tool
For specialized tasks, a custom knowledge base can be invaluable. Let’s create a tool that queries a vector database of technical documentation or specialized knowledge. Using semantic search, the agent can find the most relevant information for Alfred’s needs.
A vector database stores numerical representations (embeddings) of text or other data, created by machine learning models. It enables semantic search by identifying similar meanings in high-dimensional space.
This approach combines predefined knowledge with semantic search to provide context-aware solutions for event planning. With specialized knowledge access, Alfred can perfect every detail of the party.
In this example, we’ll create a tool that retrieves party planning ideas from a custom knowledge base. We’ll use a BM25 retriever to search the knowledge base and return the top results, and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to split the documents into smaller chunks for more efficient search.

This enhanced agent can:
1.First check the documentation for relevant information
2.Combine insights from the knowledge base
3.Maintain conversation context in memory



Enhanced Retrieval Capabilities
When building agentic RAG systems, the agent can employ sophisticated strategies like:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Query Reformulation: Instead of using the raw user query, the agent can craft optimized search terms that better match the target documents

2. Multi-Step Retrieval The agent can perform multiple searches, using initial results to inform subsequent queries

3. Source Integration Information can be combined from multiple sources like web search and local documentation

4. Result Validation Retrieved content can be analyzed for relevance and accuracy before being included in responses


Effective agentic RAG systems require careful consideration of several key aspects. The agent should select between available tools based on the query type and context. Memory systems help maintain conversation history and avoid repetitive retrievals. Having fallback strategies ensures the system can still provide value even when primary retrieval methods fail.
Additionally, implementing validation steps helps ensure the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information.
