âœ…To interact with a tool, the LLM needs an interface description with these key components:

Name: What the tool is called
Tool description: What the tool does
Input types and descriptions: What arguments the tool accepts
Output type: What the tool returns

For instance, while preparing for a party at Wayne Manor, Alfred needs various tools to gather information - from searching for catering services to finding party theme ideas. Hereâ€™s how a simple search tool interface might look:

Name: web_search
Tool description: Searches the web for specific queries
Input: query (string) - The search term to look up
Output: String containing the search results


âœ…In smolagents, tools can be defined in two ways:
Using the @tool decorator for simple function-based tools
Creating a subclass of Tool for more complex functionality





âœ…Default Toolbox
smolagents comes with a set of pre-built tools that can be directly injected into your agent. The default toolbox includes:

PythonInterpreterTool
FinalAnswerTool
UserInputTool
DuckDuckGoSearchTool
GoogleSearchTool
VisitWebpageTool
Alfred could use various tools to ensure a flawless party at Wayne Manor:

First, he could use the DuckDuckGoSearchTool to find creative superhero-themed party ideas.

For catering, heâ€™d rely on the GoogleSearchTool to find the highest-rated services in Gotham.

To manage seating arrangements, Alfred could run calculations with the PythonInterpreterTool.

Once everything is gathered, heâ€™d compile the plan using the FinalAnswerTool.

With these tools, Alfred guarantees the party is both exceptional and seamless. ðŸ¦‡ðŸ’¡
