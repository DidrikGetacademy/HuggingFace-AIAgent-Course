######Vision Agents with smolagents######
âœ…Empowering agents with visual capabilities is crucial for solving tasks that go beyond text processingâœ…
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many real-world challenges, such as web browsing or document understanding, require analyzing rich visual content.
Fortunately, smolagents provides built-in support for vision-language models (VLMs), enabling agents to process and interpret images effectively.
In this example, imagine Alfred, the butler at Wayne Manor, is tasked with verifying the identities of the guests attending the party. As you can imagine, 
Alfred may not be familiar with everyone arriving. To help him, we can use an agent that verifies their identity by searching for visual information about their appearance using a VLM.

This will allow Alfred to make informed decisions about who can enter. Letâ€™s build this example!

âœ…Providing Images with Dynamic Retrievalâœ…
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“‘smolagents are based on the MultiStepAgent class, which is an abstraction of the ReAct framework. This class operates in a structured cycle where various variables and knowledge are logged at different stages:
-SystemPromptStep: Stores the system prompt.
-TaskStep: Logs the user query and any provided input.
-ActionStep: Captures logs from the agentâ€™s actions and results.



ðŸ“‘This structured approach (see img on link) allows agents to incorporate visual information dynamically and respond adaptively to evolving tasks. Below is the diagram weâ€™ve already seen, 
illustrating the dynamic workflow process and how different steps integrate within the agent lifecycle. When browsing, the agent can take screenshots and save them as observation_images in the ActionStep.

ðŸ“‘This will allow us to build an agent that explores the web, searching for details about a potential guest and retrieving verification information. Letâ€™s install the tools needed:
