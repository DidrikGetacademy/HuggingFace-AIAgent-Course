Thought: Internal Reasoning and the Re-Act approach
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Section:
[
We dive into the inner workings of an AI Agent- its ability to reason and plan.
✅We'll explore how the agent leverages its internal dialogue to analyze information,
✅break down complex problems into manageable steps, and decide what action to take next.
✅Additionally we introduce the Re-Act approach, a prompting technique that encourages the model to think step by step before acting

📌Thoughts --->  represent the Agent's internal reasoning and planning processes to solve the ask 
•This utilises the agent's Large Language Model (LLM) capacity to analyze information when presented in its prompt...
think of it as the Agent's internal dialogue, where it considers the task at hand and strategizes its approach.
The Agent's thoughts are responsible for accessing current observation and decide what the next action(s) should be.
Through this process, the agent can break down complex problems into smaller, more managageable steps, reflect on past experiences, and continuosly adjust its plans based on new information



[Deeper explanation]
📌The Agent:
The Agent is the overarching entity that plans, makes decisions, and directs the process for solving a task.
You can view it as a kind of strategist or leader.
It receives observations, 
assesses the situation, 
and determines which actions should be taken. The Agent's "thoughts" – or its internal dialogue and planning – is a concept used to describe how it breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

📌The LLM-model (Large Language Model):
This is the engine that generates text based on the vast amounts of data it has been trained on. 
It has the ability to analyze and produce responses in natural language.
When we refer to the "Agent's thoughts," we are often talking about how the Agent uses the LLM-model to simulate internal reasoning – a "chain-of-thought."
This means that the Agent essentially delegates the computational and linguistic processing to the LLM-model.


Here are some exsamples of common thoughts: 
Type of Thought  |       Exsample    
---------------------------------------------          
Planning         | “I need to break this task into three steps: [1. gather data]  [2. analyze trends]  [3. generate report]”           
Analysis         | “Based on the error message, the issue appears to be with the database connection parameters”
Decision Making  | “Given the user’s budget constraints, I should recommend the mid-tier option”
Problem Solving  | “To optimize this code, I should first profile it to identify bottlenecks”
MemoryIntegration| “The user mentioned their preference for Python earlier, so I’ll provide examples in Python”
Self-Reflection  | “My last approach didn’t work well, I should try a different strategy”
Goal Setting     | “To complete this task, I need to first establish the acceptance criteria”
Prioritization   | “The security vulnerability should be addressed before adding new features”

📌Note: In the case of LLMs fine-tuned for function calling, the thought process is optional. in case you're not familiar with function-calling, there will be more details in the action section.




The Re-Act Approach
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A key method is the ReAct Approah, wich is the concatenation of "Reasoning" (Think) with "Acting" (Act).
ReAct is a simple prompting technique that appends "let's think step by step" before letting the LLM decode the next tokens.

indeed prompting the model to think "step by step" encourages the decoding process toward next tokens [that generate a plan] rather than a final solution, 
since the model is encouraged to [decompose] the problem into sub-tasks.

📌this allows the model to consider sub-steps in more detail, wich in general leads to less errors than trying to generate the final solution directly







This image presents a comparison of different reasoning approaches used in answering a mathematical problem. The approaches include Few-shot, Few-shot-CoT (Chain of Thought), Zero-shot, and Zero-shot-CoT. Below is a breakdown of each approach and its effectiveness:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅Few-shot (a):

•The model is given an example of a similar problem before attempting the new question.

•The response is incorrect because the model fails to break down the reasoning steps properly.

•Example Problem: A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half are golf balls, and half of the golf balls are blue. The model incorrectly answers "8" instead of "4."




✅Few-shot-CoT (b):

•The model is provided with an example that demonstrates step-by-step reasoning.

•It correctly solves the problem by first determining that there are 8 golf balls and then finding that half of them are blue, leading to the correct answer of "4."

•This method improves accuracy by encouraging structured reasoning.





✅Zero-shot (c):

•The model is given the question without prior examples or reasoning steps.

•It provides an incorrect response due to the lack of structured reasoning.

•The answer "8" is incorrect because the model does not break down the steps needed to reach the correct answer.




✅Zero-shot-CoT (d) (Ours):

•The model is instructed to "think step by step" before answering.

•It correctly determines that there are 8 golf balls and that half of them are blue, leading to the correct answer of "4."

•This approach demonstrates that prompting the model to explicitly reason through the problem improves accuracy without needing prior examples.


NOTE ----> The (d) is an exsample of Re-Act approach where we prompt ["let's think step by step"]




📌Key Takeaways:

The Few-shot and Zero-shot methods struggle with complex reasoning.

The Chain of Thought (CoT) approach significantly improves accuracy by encouraging step-by-step problem-solving.

The Zero-shot-CoT method provides an effective solution without requiring prior examples, making it a powerful approach for reasoning tasks.

This comparison highlights the importance of structured reasoning in AI models and the effectiveness of the CoT method in enhancing problem-solving accuracy.



CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT technique:
We have recently seen a lot of interest for reasoning strategies. This is what's behind models like Deepseek R1 or OpenAI's o1, which have been fine-tuned to "think before answering".
These models have been trained to always include specific thinking sections (enclosed between <think> and </think> special tokens).
 This is not just a prompting technique like ReAct, but a training method where the model learns to generate these sections after analyzing thousands of examples that show what we expect it to do.
