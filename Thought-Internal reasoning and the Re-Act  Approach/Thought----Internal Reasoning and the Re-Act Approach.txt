Thought: Internal Reasoning and the Re-Act approach
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Section:
[
We dive into the inner workings of an AI Agent- its ability to reason and plan.
✅We'll explore how the agent leverages its internal dialogue to analyze information,
✅break down complex problems into manageable steps, and decide what action to take next.
✅Additionally we introduce the Re-Act approach, a prompting technique that encourages the model to think step by step before acting

📌Thoughts --->  represent the Agent's internal reasoning and planning processes to solve the ask 
•This utilises the agent's Large Language Model (LLM) capacity to analyze information when presented in its prompt...
think of it as the Agent's internal dialogue, where it considers the task at hand and strategizes its approach.
The Agent's thoughts are responsible for accessing current observation and decide what the next action(s) should be.
Through this process, the agent can break down complex problems into smaller, more managageable steps, reflect on past experiences, and continuosly adjust its plans based on new information



[Deeper explanation]
📌The Agent:
The Agent is the overarching entity that plans, makes decisions, and directs the process for solving a task.
You can view it as a kind of strategist or leader.
It receives observations, 
assesses the situation, 
and determines which actions should be taken. The Agent's "thoughts" – or its internal dialogue and planning – is a concept used to describe how it breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

📌The LLM-model (Large Language Model):
This is the engine that generates text based on the vast amounts of data it has been trained on. 
It has the ability to analyze and produce responses in natural language.
When we refer to the "Agent's thoughts," we are often talking about how the Agent uses the LLM-model to simulate internal reasoning – a "chain-of-thought."
This means that the Agent essentially delegates the computational and linguistic processing to the LLM-model.


Here are some exsamples of common thoughts: 
Type of Thought  |       Exsample    
---------------------------------------------          
Planning         | “I need to break this task into three steps: [1. gather data]  [2. analyze trends]  [3. generate report]”           
Analysis         | “Based on the error message, the issue appears to be with the database connection parameters”
Decision Making  | “Given the user’s budget constraints, I should recommend the mid-tier option”
Problem Solving  | “To optimize this code, I should first profile it to identify bottlenecks”
MemoryIntegration| “The user mentioned their preference for Python earlier, so I’ll provide examples in Python”
Self-Reflection  | “My last approach didn’t work well, I should try a different strategy”
Goal Setting     | “To complete this task, I need to first establish the acceptance criteria”
Prioritization   | “The security vulnerability should be addressed before adding new features”

📌Note: In the case of LLMs fine-tuned for function calling, the thought process is optional. in case you're not familiar with function-calling, there will be more details in the action section.
