Creating agentic workflows in LlamaIndex
-----------------------------------------------

A workflow in LlamaIndex provides a structured way to organize your code into sequential and manageable steps.
Such a workflow is created by defining Steps which are triggered by Events, and themselves emit Events to trigger further steps.

Letâ€™s take a look at Alfred showing a LlamaIndex workflow for a RAG task.


Workflows offer several key benefits:

ðŸ”‘Clear organization of code into discrete steps

ðŸ”‘Event-driven architecture for flexible control flow

ðŸ”‘Type-safe communication between steps

ðŸ”‘Built-in state management

ðŸ”‘Support for both simple and complex agent interactions

ðŸŸ¢As you might have guessed, workflows strike a great balance between the autonomy of agents while maintaining control over the overall workflow.
