ðŸŸ¢Introduction to LlamaIndexðŸŸ¢
ðŸ”‘LlamaIndex is a complete toolkit for creating LLM-powered agents over your data using indexes and workflows


ðŸŸ¢Letâ€™s look at these key parts of LlamaIndex and how they help with agents:ðŸŸ¢
ðŸ”‘Components: Are the basic building blocks you use in LlamaIndex. These include things like prompts, models, and databases. Components often help connect LlamaIndex with other tools and libraries.
ðŸ”‘Tools: Tools are components that provide specific capabilities like searching, calculating, or accessing external services. They are the building blocks that enable agents to perform tasks.
ðŸ”‘Agents: Agents are autonomous components that can use tools and make decisions. They coordinate tool usage to accomplish complex goals.
ðŸ”‘Workflows: Are step-by-step processes that process logic together. Workflows or agentic workflows are a way to structure agentic behaviour without the explicit use of agents.


ðŸŸ¢What Makes LlamaIndex Special?ðŸŸ¢
ðŸ”‘Clear Workflow System: Workflows help break down how agents should make decisions step by step using an event-driven and async-first syntax. This helps you clearly compose and organize your logic.
ðŸ”‘Advanced Document Parsing with LlamaParse: LlamaParse was made specifically for LlamaIndex, so the integration is seamless, although it is a paid feature.
ðŸ”‘Many Ready-to-Use Components: LlamaIndex has been around for a while, so it works with lots of other frameworks. This means it has many tested and reliable components, like LLMs, retrievers, indexes, and more.
ðŸ”‘LlamaHub: is a registry of hundreds of these components, agents, and tools that you can use within LlamaIndex.
