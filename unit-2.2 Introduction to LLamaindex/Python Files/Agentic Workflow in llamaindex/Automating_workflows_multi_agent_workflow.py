#Automating workflows with Multi-Agent Workflows
    #Instead of manual workflow creation
    #we can use the AgentWorkflow class to create a multi-agent workflow. 
    #The AgentWorkflow uses Workflow Agents to allow you to create a system of one or more agents that can collaborate and hand off tasks to each other based on their specialized capabilities.
    #This enables building complex agent systems where different agents handle different aspects of a task. Instead of importing classes from llama_index.core.agent, we will import the agent classes from llama_index.core.agent.workflow. 
    #One agent must be designated as the root agent in the AgentWorkflow constructor. When a user message comes in, it is first routed to the root agent.

    #Each agent can then
        # Handle the request directly using their tools 

        # handoff to another agent better suited for the task

        # return a response to the user

# Agent tools can also modify the workflow state we mentioned earlier. Before starting the workflow, we can provide an initial state dict that will be available to all agents. 
# The state is stored in the state key of the workflow context. It will be injected into the state_prompt which augments each new user message.
# Letâ€™s inject a counter to count function calls by modifying the previous example:
